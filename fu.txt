Title: Fuzzy Set Operations in Python using scikit-fuzzy

Introduction:
Fuzzy set operations play a crucial role in handling uncertainty and imprecision in various applications. This write-up explores and demonstrates common fuzzy set operations using Python and the scikit-fuzzy library.

Installation:
Ensure that the scikit-fuzzy library is installed:

bash
Copy code
pip install -U scikit-fuzzy
Fuzzy Set Operations:

Union Operation:
The union of two fuzzy sets A and B, denoted as A ∪ B, is a fuzzy set whose membership function is the maximum of the membership values of A and B at each point.

python
Copy code
import numpy as np
import skfuzzy as fuzz

# Membership functions for sets A and B
A = np.array([0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 1.0])
B = np.array([0.8, 0.5, 0.2, 0.0])

# Union operation
union_result = np.fmax(A, B)
Intersection Operation:
The intersection of two fuzzy sets A and B, denoted as A ∩ B, is a fuzzy set whose membership function is the minimum of the membership values of A and B at each point.

python
Copy code
# Intersection operation
intersection_result = np.fmin(A, B)
Complement Operation:
The complement of a fuzzy set A, denoted as A', is a fuzzy set whose membership function is 1 minus the membership function of A.

python
Copy code
# Complement operation
complement_result = 1 - A
Conclusion:
The scikit-fuzzy library in Python provides efficient tools for performing fuzzy set operations. These operations are valuable in scenarios where uncertainties need to be managed and analyzed.
